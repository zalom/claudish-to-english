</p>

A Claude Code plugin that shows a **plain-English rewrite** of each assistant
message, produced by a **local LLM via ollama** (default), the **codex CLI**,
the **Anthropic API**, or any **OpenAI-compatible API**. It is **display-only**:
Claude's own reasoning and the saved transcript keep the original text — only
what you read on screen changes.

If your session speaks something other than English, so does the rewrite: it
follows the message's own language, or the `language` setting Claude Code
already answers in. See [Output language](#output-language).

An optional second hook rewrites **Markdown files** into plain language when
they are written or edited (opt-in, off by default).

> Status: working prototype. Every hook fails **open** — if anything goes wrong
> (provider down, timeout, missing key or dependency), you simply see Claude's
> original text. The plugin can never swallow or corrupt an answer.

## Requirements (read this first)

With the default `ollama` provider this plugin shells out to a **local** model,
and nothing works until these are in place. (With `CLAUDISH_PROVIDER=anthropic`
or `openai` you need only `jq`, `curl`, and an API key — see
[Providers](#providers).)

<a id="macos-setup"></a>
<details>
<summary><strong>macOS setup</strong></summary>

| Requirement | Why | Install |
|---|---|---|
| **ollama**, running | Does the rewriting, locally | `brew install ollama` then `ollama serve` |
| A pulled model | The actual rewriter | `ollama pull gemma4:26b-mlx` (~17 GB; choose the model that fits into your memory) |
| `jq` | Parses hook JSON | ships with macOS 15+; else `brew install jq` |
| `curl` | Talks to ollama | ships with macOS |

Warm the model once after `ollama serve` (the first call is a slow cold load):

```bash
ollama run gemma4:26b-mlx "hi"
```

**If the local model isn't ready, the plugin does nothing to your text** —
Claude's output shows normally, unchanged. That is by design, not a bug. It skips
(fails open) when ollama is down, the request times out, or the model isn't
pulled. The first time that happens in a session it tells you why: the display
hook appends a one-line notice on screen, and the Markdown hook shows a
`systemMessage`. So a silent skip is never a mystery (once per session; set
`CLAUDISH_NOTICE=0` to silence it).

**Pick a model you actually have.** The default is `gemma4:26b-mlx`, an
Apple-silicon (MLX) build — the right choice on a Mac, but **macOS-only**. On
Windows it doesn't run, so you must switch to a regular tag (see
[Windows setup](#windows-setup)). Pull it (as above), or pull a smaller/faster
model and point the plugin at it by setting `CLAUDISH_MODEL` to that model's
exact ollama tag in your `env` (see
[Configuring the plugin](#configuring-the-plugin)). If `CLAUDISH_MODEL` names a
model you have not pulled, every rewrite is skipped — with the one-time notice
above.

<summary><strong>Windows setup</strong></summary>

The hooks are bash scripts; on Windows, Claude Code runs them through **Git
Bash** (Git for Windows).

| Requirement | Why | Install |
|---|---|---|
| **Ollama**, running | Does the rewriting, locally | `winget install Ollama.Ollama`, then launch the Ollama app; it serves on `localhost:11434` |
| A pulled model | The actual rewriter | `ollama pull gemma4:26b` (choose a model that fits into your memory) |
| `jq` | Parses hook JSON | `winget install jqlang.jq` |
| `curl` | Talks to ollama | ships with Windows 10+ |
| Git Bash | Runs the hook scripts | Claude Code users usually already have it; else `winget install Git.Git` |

Restart your terminal after installing so `jq`, `ollama`, and Git Bash are on
PATH (check `jq --version` and `ollama --version`).

> **The default model is macOS-only — Windows users must override it.** The
> plugin's default, `gemma4:26b-mlx`, is an Apple-silicon (MLX) build that doesn't
> run on Windows, so leaving it unset means every rewrite is silently skipped.
> Always set `CLAUDISH_MODEL` to a regular (non-MLX) tag on Windows. The table
> above uses `gemma4:26b` as an example; choose another if it fits your machine
> better.

Warm the model once after launching Ollama (the first call is a slow cold load):

```powershell
ollama run gemma4:26b "hi"
```

Then set `CLAUDISH_MODEL` in the `env` block of your `settings.json` (see
[Configuring the plugin](#configuring-the-plugin) — that method is identical on
Windows), or for a one-off session from PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:CLAUDISH_MODEL = "gemma4:26b"; claude
```

Windows equivalents of the mid-session kill switch
([Toggling mid-session](#toggling-mid-session)):

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType File $HOME\.claude\claudish-off   # pause rewrites
Remove-Item $HOME\.claude\claudish-off               # resume
```

(In Git Bash the `touch`/`rm` commands from that section work as-is.)

Notes:
- Write `CLAUDISH_MD_DIR` with forward slashes
(`C:/dev/docs/plain`) so the bash-side path checks match
- The `CLAUDISH_DEBUG=1` log lands under Git Bash's temp directory
(`$TMPDIR/claudish-to-english/`, typically
`C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Local\Temp\claudish-to-english\`).

## Install

Directly from this repository (also serves its own marketplace):

```shell
/plugin marketplace add gvzdv/claudish-to-english
/plugin install claudish-to-english@gvzdv-plugins
```

After review by the Anthropic team, the plugin will be available to install from the community marketplace:

```shell
/plugin marketplace add anthropics/claude-plugins-community
/plugin install claudish-to-english@claude-community
```

If the install summary says `Run /reload-plugins to activate.`, run that command.

**Try before installing** (loads it for one session, no install):

```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/claudish-to-english
```

Run `/reload-plugins` after edits; if it doesn't load, check the `/plugin`
**Errors** tab.

---

## Configuring the plugin

There are two ways to control claudish, and they complement each other:

- **`/claudish`** — a slash command for live, day-to-day toggles: on/off, display
  mode, language, and model. Changes take effect immediately, mid-session. This
  is what most people reach for. See
  [Controlling it live](#controlling-it-live-claudish).
- **`CLAUDISH_*` environment variables** — your durable defaults, and the only
  way to set everything `/claudish` doesn't cover (provider, API keys, base URLs,
  the Markdown hook, timeouts). Full list in
  [Configuration](#configuration-env-vars) below.

Set the durable ones in Claude Code's **`env` block in `settings.json`** — do
**not** edit the plugin's own `hooks/hooks.json`, which lives in the read-only
plugin cache (`~/.claude/plugins/cache/…`) and is overwritten on every update.

For a personal, all-projects setup, use `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDISH_MODEL": "gemma4:26b-mlx",
    "CLAUDISH_MODE": "append"
  }
}
```

The hooks are subprocesses Claude Code spawns, so they inherit these. A few
things to know:

- **Restart Claude Code after editing `env`.** The value is captured at launch,
  so a running session keeps the old one.
- **`env` does not merge across scopes.** The highest-precedence settings file
  that defines `env` supplies the *entire* block — it isn't combined with lower
  scopes. Precedence: managed → local → project → user. Keep all your
  `CLAUDISH_*` vars in whichever file wins.
- **Scopes:** `~/.claude/settings.json` (all your projects) ·
  `.claude/settings.json` (shared with a repo, checked in) ·
  `.claude/settings.local.json` (just you, just this repo).

Quick one-off without editing a file — hooks inherit the launching shell:

```bash
CLAUDISH_MODEL=llama3.2:3b claude
```

To confirm the hook is firing, set `CLAUDISH_DEBUG=1` and watch
`"$TMPDIR"/claudish-to-english/debug.log`.

---

## Controlling it live: `/claudish`

`/claudish` is the interactive front-end for the four most-used settings —
on/off, display mode, language, and model. Changes take effect on the next
assistant message, mid-session, with nothing to relaunch:

```
/claudish              show the dashboard (current state + where each value comes from)
/claudish on           resume rewrites (keeps the current mode)
/claudish off          pause rewrites (originals only; also pauses the Markdown hook)
/claudish append       show the original, then the rewrite below it
/claudish replace      show only the rewrite
/claudish style tldr   rewrite as a short summary (or "5y" = explain like I'm five)
/claudish style        reset to the default plain-language rewrite
/claudish language fr  rewrite into French (any name, incl. non-Latin like 简体中文)
/claudish language     reset to the session/settings language (see "Output language")
/claudish model X      use model X for whatever provider is configured
/claudish model        reset to the provider default
/claudish last         reprint the ORIGINAL of the last message (handy in replace mode)
/claudish cycle        step off → append → replace → off
/claudish reset        clear ALL overrides — back to your env/settings defaults
```

Bare `/claudish` prints a **dashboard** — each setting, its current value, and
where that value comes from (an env var, a `/claudish` override, your
`settings.json`, or the default):

```
  claudish · plain-language rewrite of each assistant message

  status    replace          · ⚠ /claudish — rewrite only; beats env, persists across sessions
  style     tldr             · ⚠ /claudish — beats env CLAUDISH_STYLE, persists across sessions
  language  French           · ⚠ /claudish — beats env & settings, persists across sessions
  model     gemma4:26b-mlx   · ollama provider default
  provider  ollama           · default
```

Each switch writes a small flag file under `~/.claude/` that the hooks re-read
every message (the paths and their `CLAUDISH_*_FILE` overrides are in the
[env-var table](#configuration-env-vars); the underlying mechanism is under
[Toggling mid-session](#toggling-mid-session)). A live `/claudish` switch **beats
the matching env var** — `CLAUDISH_MODE`, `CLAUDISH_LANG`, or `CLAUDISH_MODEL`.

**These overrides persist across sessions** (like the off-file), until you clear
them with the per-setting `default` form, `/claudish on`, or `/claudish reset`.
So a `/claudish language French` set today still applies to a session you open
tomorrow. The state is never silent, though: the dashboard flags every persisting
override with ⚠, and a `SessionStart` notice lists any that are active at the top
of a new session (`CLAUDISH_NOTICE=0` silences it). For a *permanent* default,
set the matching env var in `settings.json` rather than using `/claudish`.

`/claudish last` works because the rewrite is display-only: the transcript always
keeps Claude's original text, so the command just reprints it (prefixed with an
internal `<!-- claudish:original -->` marker that tells the display hook not to
rewrite that reply, and which is stripped from view).

---

## Output language

The rewrite comes back in the **same language as the text it rewrites**. An
Esperanto answer is simplified into Esperanto, an English one into English;
nothing is translated unless you ask for it.

To pin a language, set one. The hooks read the same `language` key Claude Code
itself answers in, in the same order of precedence, so a session that already
speaks Esperanto needs no extra configuration:

| Source | Example |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDISH_LANG` (env) | `"CLAUDISH_LANG": "Esperanto"` |
| `<project>/.claude/settings.local.json` | `"language": "Esperanto"` |
| `<project>/.claude/settings.json` | `"language": "Esperanto"` |
| `~/.claude/settings.json` | `"language": "Esperanto"` |

The first one that is set wins, and the on-screen label then names it:
`💬 In plain Esperanto:`. `CLAUDISH_LANG` set but **empty** ignores the settings
key and goes back to following the input's language; set it to `English` to
force English on a non-English session.

A configured language is appended to the built-in prompt. A prompt supplied
through `CLAUDISH_PROMPT_FILE` or `CLAUDISH_MD_PROMPT_FILE` replaces the whole
prompt, language line included — that file is your prompt in full, and it
states its own language (see below).

An unreadable, malformed, or non-string setting is ignored the way every other
failure here is: rewrites keep working, in the input's language.

One caveat: a rewrite is only as good as the model that writes it, and small
local models simplify English noticeably better than they simplify anything
else. If non-English results disappoint, try a larger model or a cloud provider
(see [Providers](#providers)).

---

## Customizing the rewrite prompt

Each hook ships with a default system prompt that asks the model for plain
language while preserving facts, code, and structure.

For a quick change of tone without writing a prompt, the display hook also has
two **built-in style presets** — `tldr` (a short summary) and `5y` (explain like
I'm five) — set with [`/claudish style`](#controlling-it-live-claudish) or
`CLAUDISH_STYLE`. For full control, you can instead **replace** either prompt
with your own to add specific rules or use wording that works better with your
model (this wins over a style preset). To do so, point the hook at a file that
holds the prompt:

| Hook | Prompt file |
|---|---|
| Display (`rewrite.sh`) | `CLAUDISH_PROMPT_FILE` |
| Markdown (`rewrite-md.sh`) | `CLAUDISH_MD_PROMPT_FILE` |

The file's contents **replace** the built-in prompt, so
include every instruction you want the model to follow — otherwise the defaults
(keep facts, leave code blocks alone, output only the rewrite) are gone. Keeping
the prompt in a file avoids escaping a long, multi-line prompt inside a JSON
string. If the variable is unset, or the file is empty or unreadable, the hook
falls back to its built-in default, so a bad path never stops rewrites.

```json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDISH_PROMPT_FILE": "/ABS/PATH/prompts/plain.txt",
    "CLAUDISH_MD_PROMPT_FILE": "/ABS/PATH/prompts/md-plain.txt"
  }
}
```

The display hook still appends the **original user question** to your prompt, as
context to keep the rewrite on-topic (see
[How the display hook works](#how-the-display-hook-works)). Your prompt
replaces only the base instruction.

---

## How the display hook works

Claude Code fires the `MessageDisplay` event **once per streamed chunk**, not
once per message. Each fire is a separate process carrying `message_id`,
`index`, a `final` flag, and this chunk's `delta` (a text fragment, not the
whole message). So the hook **buffers every delta** to a temp file (keyed by
`message_id`) and only calls the model on the **final** chunk, once the whole
message is known:

```
chunk 0 (final:false) ─┐
chunk 1 (final:false) ─┤ append each delta to $TMPDIR/claudish-to-english/<session>/<message>/<index>.part
chunk 2 (final:false) ─┘  → emit nothing (append) or "" (replace)
chunk 3 (final:true)  ──► reconstruct full message → call ollama once → show the rewrite
                          → delete the buffer
```

On that final chunk it also reads the **original user question** from the
transcript and passes it to the model as **context only** — to keep the rewrite
on-topic. The model is told never to answer or repeat the question; it only
rewrites the assistant's message.

### Display modes

| `CLAUDISH_MODE` | On screen | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `append` (default) | Original streams normally, then a `💬 In plain language:` block is appended (`💬 In plain Esperanto:` when a language is configured). | Safest. No streaming loss; if the LLM fails you just don't get the extra block. |
| `replace` | Only the simplified version (original chunks suppressed while streaming). | Experimental. Appears all at once after LLM latency; on failure it re-shows the full original. |

---

## Markdown file rewrite (optional second hook)

A `PostToolUse` hook (`rewrite-md.sh`) rewrites Markdown **files** into plain
language when they are written or edited. Unlike the display hook, this changes
bytes on disk.

**Opt-in by directory.** It does nothing unless `CLAUDISH_MD_DIR` is set, and it
only touches `*.md` files whose resolved path is inside that directory. Every
other `README`, `CLAUDE.md`, or doc you edit is left alone.

| `CLAUDISH_MD_MODE` | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `sibling` (default) | Writes `NAME.plain.md` next to `NAME.md`. | Non-destructive; the original is never touched. |
| `overwrite` | Replaces `NAME.md` in place. | Adds a `<!-- claudish-to-english:rewritten -->` marker so a re-write is skipped (idempotent). A weak model can degrade real docs — use with care. |

In both modes: YAML frontmatter is split off and re-attached **verbatim**, fenced
code is left to the model instruction, short files are skipped, and the write is
atomic. Fail-open here means the file is left **exactly as the agent wrote it**.

**Large files are slow.** `gemma4:26b-mlx` (the default) rewrites at roughly 60
tokens/s, so a long plan or spec can take 30–120s. This hook allows up to
`CLAUDISH_MD_TIMEOUT` (150s) inside a 180s `PostToolUse` hook budget; if a rewrite
still times out you get the one-time notice above — raise those limits, or set
`CLAUDISH_MODEL` to a smaller model.

Enable it for one directory, in sibling mode (the safe default), the same way
as every other setting — the `env` block of your `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDISH_MD_DIR": "/ABS/PATH/docs/plain",
    "CLAUDISH_MD_MODE": "sibling"
  }
}
```

In `overwrite` mode the marker comment is written **after** any YAML
frontmatter, so the frontmatter stays on line 1 where parsers expect it.

---

## Providers

Rewrites go through one of four providers, selected with `CLAUDISH_PROVIDER`
(both hooks share the setting). The default is unchanged from upstream: local
ollama, nothing leaves your machine.

| Provider | Endpoint | Key | Default model |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ollama` (default) | `CLAUDISH_OLLAMA` (`http://localhost:11434`) | none | `gemma4:26b-mlx` |
| `codex` | OpenAI codex CLI (`codex exec`) — uses the CLI's own login | none | *(CLI default)* |
| `anthropic` | `CLAUDISH_ANTHROPIC_URL` (`https://api.anthropic.com`) + `/v1/messages` | `CLAUDISH_ANTHROPIC_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `claude-haiku-4-5` |
| `openai` | `CLAUDISH_OPENAI_URL` + `/chat/completions` | `CLAUDISH_OPENAI_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `gpt-5.6-luna` |

### codex

`CLAUDISH_PROVIDER=codex` runs the rewrite through the OpenAI codex CLI
(`codex exec`, read-only sandbox, outside any repo), using the CLI's own
login. No API key and no local model server. `CLAUDISH_MODEL` overrides
the CLI's configured model; unset uses the CLI default. `CLAUDISH_CODEX_EFFORT`
overrides the CLI's reasoning effort for the rewrite only (e.g. `low` keeps a
per-message rewrite fast even when the CLI's coding default is a high-effort
tier). Requires `codex` on PATH; fails open like every other provider.

> [!CAUTION]
> The cloud providers pick their key up from the **ambient environment**
> (`OPENAI_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`), and `CLAUDISH_OPENAI_URL` defaults
> to api.openai.com. Anything that puts those variables into the environment
> Claude Code launches with — an `export` in your shell profile, a tool like
> direnv loading a project's `.env` into your shell, or the `env` block of a
> settings file — makes them visible to this plugin. In such an environment,
> setting the single variable `CLAUDISH_PROVIDER=openai` starts sending every
> assistant message (and, with the Markdown hook, file contents) to OpenAI's
> cloud. Likewise, `CLAUDISH_PROVIDER=anthropic` will quietly spend the same
> `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (and share its rate limits) that other tools on your
> machine may rely on. Selecting a cloud provider IS the consent switch — set
> it only when you mean it, and use the `CLAUDISH_*_KEY` variables when you
> want the plugin on a dedicated key.

```bash
# ollama (default) — local, nothing leaves your machine
export CLAUDISH_PROVIDER=ollama
export CLAUDISH_MODEL=gemma4:26b-mlx        # the default; any pulled tag works

# Anthropic — Claude Haiku
export CLAUDISH_PROVIDER=anthropic
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
export CLAUDISH_MODEL=claude-haiku-4-5      # the default; override to taste

# OpenAI — GPT-5.6 Luna
export CLAUDISH_PROVIDER=openai
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export CLAUDISH_MODEL=gpt-5.6-luna          # the default; override to taste

# Any OpenAI-compatible server (LM Studio, llama.cpp server, vLLM, OpenRouter).
# A key is only required for api.openai.com — local servers work keyless.
export CLAUDISH_PROVIDER=openai
export CLAUDISH_OPENAI_URL=http://localhost:1234/v1
export CLAUDISH_MODEL=qwen3-30b
```

Notes:

- `CLAUDISH_MODEL` overrides any provider's default model.
- Requests to api.openai.com send `reasoning_effort: "none"` (GPT-5.6-class
  models otherwise spend reasoning tokens on a plain rewrite). Custom
  OpenAI-compatible URLs get no such field, since some local servers reject
  unknown fields. Force one with `CLAUDISH_OPENAI_EFFORT`, or set it
  **explicitly empty** (`CLAUDISH_OPENAI_EFFORT=`) to omit the field even for
  api.openai.com — needed for models that reject `reasoning_effort` entirely.
- The anthropic provider caps completions at `CLAUDISH_MAX_TOKENS` (default
  4096, since the Messages API requires an explicit cap).
- A rewrite that hits an output-token cap is **discarded**, not shown — on the
  ollama, anthropic, and openai providers (ollama's `done_reason: "length"`
  included): a half-finished
  rewrite on screen is confusing, and in the Markdown hook's `overwrite` mode
  it would replace your real document. You get the original text plus the
  once-per-session notice suggesting a higher cap.
- Every provider failure stays fail-open: missing key, bad key, unreachable
  endpoint, or timeout just leaves the original text (plus the once-per-session
  notice, unless `CLAUDISH_NOTICE=0`).

> **Privacy:** the cloud providers send each assistant message (and, for the
> Markdown hook, file contents) to an external API. Read
> [Privacy / egress](#privacy--egress) before switching away from ollama.

## Configuration (env vars)

| Var | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `CLAUDISH_ENABLED` | `1` | Master switch. `0` = pass everything through. Read once at session start. |
| `CLAUDISH_OFF_FILE` | `~/.claude/claudish-off` | Runtime kill switch. While this file exists, rewrites pause — re-checked every message, so unlike env vars it works mid-session. See [Toggling mid-session](#toggling-mid-session). |
| `CLAUDISH_MODE` | `append` | `append` or `replace` (display hook). |
| `CLAUDISH_MODE_FILE` | `~/.claude/claudish-mode` | Runtime display-mode override: `append`/`replace` in this file wins over `CLAUDISH_MODE`, re-checked every message. Written by `/claudish append`/`replace`. See [Controlling it live](#controlling-it-live-claudish). |
| `CLAUDISH_STYLE` | *(unset)* | Rewrite-style preset (display hook): `tldr` = a clearly shorter summary, `5y` = explain like I'm five. Unset = the default plain-language rewrite. A usable `CLAUDISH_PROMPT_FILE` wins over any style (custom prompt > style > built-in); the output language still applies. |
| `CLAUDISH_STYLE_FILE` | `~/.claude/claudish-style` | Runtime style override: `tldr`/`5y` in this file wins over `CLAUDISH_STYLE`, re-checked every message. Written by `/claudish style <tldr\|5y>`. See [Controlling it live](#controlling-it-live-claudish). |
| `CLAUDISH_PROMPT_FILE` | *(unset)* | Path to a file whose contents replace the display hook's system prompt (whole prompt, not merged). Empty/unreadable falls back to the built-in default. See [Customizing the rewrite prompt](#customizing-the-rewrite-prompt). |
| `CLAUDISH_LANG` | *(unset)* | Language to rewrite into, e.g. `Esperanto`. Unset falls back to the `language` key in `.claude/settings*.json`; with neither set, the rewrite keeps the input's language. Empty ignores the settings key; `English` forces English. See [Output language](#output-language). |
| `CLAUDISH_LANG_FILE` | `~/.claude/claudish-lang` | Runtime language override: a language name in this file wins over `CLAUDISH_LANG` and the settings key, re-checked every message. Written by `/claudish language <name>`. See [Controlling it live](#controlling-it-live-claudish). |
| `CLAUDISH_PROVIDER` | `ollama` | `ollama`, `codex`, `anthropic`, or `openai` — which LLM serves rewrites (both hooks). |
| `CLAUDISH_MODEL` | *(per provider)* | Model name; overrides the provider default (see [Providers](#providers)). The ollama default `gemma4:26b-mlx` is MLX (Apple-silicon only; Windows users must override). |
| `CLAUDISH_MODEL_FILE` | `~/.claude/claudish-model` | Runtime model override: a model name in this file wins over `CLAUDISH_MODEL`, re-checked every message (applies to whatever provider is configured). Written by `/claudish model <name>`. See [Controlling it live](#controlling-it-live-claudish). |
| `CLAUDISH_OLLAMA` | `http://localhost:11434` | ollama base URL. |
| `CLAUDISH_ANTHROPIC_KEY` | *(unset)* | Anthropic API key; falls back to `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. |
| `CLAUDISH_OPENAI_KEY` | *(unset)* | OpenAI(-compatible) API key; falls back to `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Only required for api.openai.com. |
| `CLAUDISH_OPENAI_URL` | `https://api.openai.com/v1` | Base URL for any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (LM Studio, llama.cpp server, vLLM, OpenRouter, ...). Trailing slashes are ignored. |
| `CLAUDISH_ANTHROPIC_URL` | `https://api.anthropic.com` | Base URL for the anthropic provider — override for proxies/gateways that speak the Messages API. |
| `CLAUDISH_OPENAI_EFFORT` | `none` on api.openai.com, else *(unset)* | `reasoning_effort` sent with openai-provider requests. Set explicitly empty to omit the field. |
| `CLAUDISH_CODEX_EFFORT` | *(unset)* | `model_reasoning_effort` for the codex provider (e.g. `low`). Unset uses the codex CLI's configured effort. Applies to the rewrite only. |
| `CLAUDISH_MAX_TOKENS` | `4096` | Completion cap for the anthropic provider. Rewrites that hit the cap are discarded (fail-open), with a notice to raise it. |
| `CLAUDISH_MIN_CHARS` | `200` | Skip messages/files whose prose (code stripped) is shorter than this. |
| `CLAUDISH_STUB` | `0` | `1` = deterministic stub instead of the model (for testing display mechanics). |
| `CLAUDISH_TIMEOUT` | `45` | LLM client timeout for the **display** hook (seconds). Keep it below that hook's `timeout` (60s). |
| `CLAUDISH_MD_TIMEOUT` | `150` | LLM client timeout for the **Markdown file** hook (seconds). Higher on purpose — a large model rewriting a long doc is slow. Keep it below the `PostToolUse` hook `timeout` (180s). |
| `CLAUDISH_DEBUG` | `0` | `1` = write a debug log to `$TMPDIR/claudish-to-english/`. |
| `CLAUDISH_NOTICE` | `1` | `1` = show a one-time, once-per-session notice when a rewrite is skipped because the provider is unreachable, the call timed out, a key is missing, or the model isn't available (display hook appends it on screen; Markdown hook uses a `systemMessage`). Also gates the `SessionStart` notice that announces leftover `/claudish` overrides. `0` = stay fully silent (pure fail-open). |
| `CLAUDISH_MD_DIR` | *(unset)* | **Markdown hook opt-in.** Only `*.md` under this directory is rewritten. Unset = the Markdown hook does nothing. |
| `CLAUDISH_MD_MODE` | `sibling` | `sibling` (`NAME.plain.md`) or `overwrite` (in place). |
| `CLAUDISH_MD_SUFFIX` | `plain` | Sibling infix: `NAME.<suffix>.md`. |
| `CLAUDISH_MD_PROMPT_FILE` | *(unset)* | Path to a file whose contents replace the Markdown hook's system prompt (whole prompt, not merged). Empty/unreadable falls back to the built-in default. |

In `hooks/hooks.json` the display hook (`MessageDisplay`) has a 60s `timeout` and
the Markdown hook (`PostToolUse`) has a 180s `timeout` — the file hook is higher
because a large model rewriting a long document can take a couple of minutes.
`CLAUDISH_TIMEOUT` and `CLAUDISH_MD_TIMEOUT` keep the LLM call itself bounded
below those ceilings, so it fails open cleanly instead of being killed mid-write.

**Quick kill switch:** set `CLAUDISH_ENABLED=0` or disable the plugin (both apply
only from the next session start), or `touch ~/.claude/claudish-off` to pause a
session that's already running — see [Toggling mid-session](#toggling-mid-session)
below.

### Toggling mid-session

`CLAUDISH_ENABLED` and the other env vars are read once, when a session launches,
so they can't pause rewrites in a session that's already running. For that, both
hooks also check a **flag file** on every invocation — each fire is a fresh
process, so the check is always live:

```bash
touch ~/.claude/claudish-off   # pause rewrites, effective on the next message
rm    ~/.claude/claudish-off   # resume
```

You create and remove this file yourself; nothing creates it on install, and its
absence is the normal "on" state. While it exists, `ENABLED` is forced to `0` and
the fail-open path leaves Claude's original text untouched. Point a hotkey at a
two-line toggle script to flip rewrites from the keyboard across all running
sessions at once. Override the path with `CLAUDISH_OFF_FILE`. `/claudish`
([Controlling it live](#controlling-it-live-claudish)) is the friendly front-end
for this, writing the same kind of flag files for mode, language, and model too.

### Reasoning models

The ollama request sends `"think": false`, and openai-provider requests to
api.openai.com send `reasoning_effort: "none"`. Models with a hidden reasoning
phase otherwise spend most of their time generating reasoning tokens you never
see — much slower for identical output quality on this simple task. Keep it off.

---

## Privacy / egress

With the default provider the rewriter runs **entirely locally** against
ollama, so **no conversation content leaves your machine**. Setting
`CLAUDISH_PROVIDER` to `anthropic` or `openai` changes that deliberately: every
rewritten assistant message (and, with the Markdown hook enabled, file
contents) is sent to that API. The same applies to pointing `CLAUDISH_OLLAMA`
or `CLAUDISH_OPENAI_URL` at a remote/hosted endpoint. Don't switch away from
local unless you understand and accept it.

## Tests and evals

- `tests/test-rewrite-prompt.sh` runs the real `rewrite.sh` with a stub
  `providers.sh` and checks the prompt it builds: the message is framed as
  text to rewrite, the user turn is the untouched message behind a
  "Rewrite this assistant message:" line, and the framing survives the
  style presets, a custom prompt file, and the context line. No network, no
  keys; safe for CI.
- `evals/rewrite-prompt-eval.sh` replays the fixtures in `evals/fixtures/`
  through the real hook and the real model, several runs each, and counts
  how often the model answered the message instead of rewriting it. It
  spends model calls, so run it by hand when the prompt or the model
  changes. `CLAUDISH_EVAL_AUTH` picks the path: `claude` (default, headless
  `claude -p`), `oauth`, `apikey` (skips without a key), or `env`.
  `CLAUDISH_EVAL_PROVIDERS` points it at another `providers.sh` when the
  path you want lives on a different branch.
